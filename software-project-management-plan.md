#### 3.1.3 Resource Acquisition

##### 3.1.3.1 Hardware Resources

Each team member will work from home and will be given a 14-inch MacBook Pro with:

- 11-core CPU14-core GPU
- 18GB Unified Memory
- 512GB SSD Storage

People are expected to work from home so if employers need dongles, mouses or extra screens to develop, they need to request it to the IT Person.

##### 3.1.3.2 Software Resources

We are going to Use Slack to communicate, our project will be in Github

##### 3.1.3.2 Other Resources

Other resources will need to be asked to the project manager

## 3.2 Work Plan

### 3.2.1 Work Breakdown Structure

WBS of the work that is going to be done

![WBS Tasks Image](/WBS%20Tasks.png)

### Gantt Chart

This Gantt chart shows the schedule where the WBS will be completed by

![Gantt Chart](/4050Gantt_Light.png)

### 3.2.2 Schedule and resource allocation

The team will create a schedule for each member at the onset of every project phase. Furthermore, adjustments to individual schedules will be made based on the workload each team member faces during that particular period. This approach aims to maintain a balanced workload across the team.

## 3.3 Project Tracking Plan

### 3.3.1 Process for Measuring

We are going to measure success in how many user stories where completed in a sprint

### 3.3.2 Changes Request

Since we are using agile, changes will be more usual, we need to ensure that there is a meeting with all the stakeholders to ensure it follows our vision

### 3.3.3 Schedule Control

Since we are going to use agile, the schedule will be reassessed in every retrospective and sprint planning, will measure how much work has been done in the milestone and what actions we need to do to complete work in time

### 3.3.4 Communication plan

As mentioned before, we will use Slack as main method of communication, we are going to use agile so we will have:

- Two week sprints, starting on mondays with an hour sprint planning meeting
- Daily 15 minute standup with the developers to see what what they are doing or if they need any help
- One hour retrospectives every 2 weeks with the dev team

The developers and the project manager will assist these meetings, the QA will join them after they start QA

The IT will request equipment from the project manager as needed and will have a meeting at least twice a week

### 3.4 Risk Management Plan

### 3.4.1 Main Risks

1. **Unforeseen Call Scenarios** - They cause system glitches, such as calls to busy lines or invalid numbers.

2. **Data Breach or Unauthorized Access** - especially for the System Console and User Accounts.

3. **Billing Discrepancies** - leading to potential customer grievances.

4. **System Overload** - especially if the number of calls nears the set limit, affecting call quality.

### 3.4.2 Response Plan

| Risk                                   | Response Strategy | Mitigation                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unforeseen Call Scenarios**          | Avoidance         | Integrate advanced call routing algorithms and fallback mechanisms.                                         |
| **Data Breach or Unauthorized Access** | Avoidance         | Employ stringent security measures, including multi-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption.        |
| **Billing Discrepancies**              | Avoidance         | Implement robust billing verification mechanisms and provide users with a transparent breakdown of charges. |
| **System Overload**                    | Avoidance         | Design an alert system for administrators and consider elastic scalability solutions.                       |

#### 3.5 Project Closeout

To ensure that we can closeout the project we need:

- Final Code Review: Conduct a thorough review of the final codebase to ensure it meets quality standards and follows coding conventions.
- Testing and Quality Assurance: Perform final testing to verify the software's functionality and address any remaining bugs or issues.
- Documentation Completion: Ensure all project documentation, and training was done successfully
- Meet Milestone: Make sure that the project has met its objectives from milestones set by the stakeholders.
- Archive Project Materials: Archive all project-related materials, including code repositories, documents, and any other relevant data for future reference.
- Final Retrospective: Hold a team retrospective session to discuss the project's successes, challenges, and lessons learned.
- Equipment and Resource Return: Arrange for the return of any borrowed or leased equipment and release resources allocated for the project.
- Post-Implementation Support Plan: Establish a plan for post-implementation support, including maintenance and addressing any post-launch issues.
- Legal and Contractual Closure: Ensure all legal and contractual obligations are fulfilled, and contracts are officially closed.
- Celebrate Project Completion: Celebrate the successful completion of the project with the team, acknowledging their hard work and dedication.
