### 4.1 Methods, Tools, and Techniques

- **Software Development Methodology:** Agile Scrum will be employed, facilitating iterative development and regular reassessment of project priorities.

- **Tools:**

  - **Coding:** Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA for development.
  - **Version Control:** Git with GitHub for repository management.
  - **Project Management:** JIRA for tracking progress and managing sprints.
  - **Collaboration:** Slack for team communication and Zoom for virtual meetings.

- **Techniques:**

  - **Requirement Gathering:** User story mapping and backlog grooming sessions.
  - **Design:** Use of UML diagrams for system architecture and database design.
  - **Testing:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
  - **Deployment:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins.\

- **Configuration Management Plan:** Utilize Git for version control, with a branching strategy incorporating feature, develop, and master branches.
- **Quality Assurance Plan:** Regular code reviews, adherence to coding standards, and automated testing to ensure quality.

### 4.2 Software Documentation

- **Documentation:** All of the projects documentation will be managed in Confluence, and API documentation will be managed in Swagger.
- **Naming Conventions and Style Guides:** Follow Google's style guides for code documentation. Variables, functions, and classes will use camelCase naming for consistency.
- **Maintenance Plan:** Documentation will be reviewed and updated at the end of each sprint. The responsibility will be assigned on a rotating basis among team members.

### 4.3 Project Support Functions

**Quality Assurance (QA):**

- **Call Quality Testing:** Dedicated QA testing for audio quality and connection stability across different network conditions, ensuring high-quality voice calls.
- **User Interface Testing:** Special focus on testing the user interfaces of the System Console and client apps for usability and responsiveness.
- **Security Testing:** Emphasis on end-to-end encryption testing and user authentication processes, crucial for the privacy and security of calls and user data.

**Secretarial and Administrative Support:**

- **Meeting Coordination:** Regularly scheduled meetings with the client to discuss progress, gather feedback, and refine requirements.
- **Document Management:** Maintaining up-to-date project documentation, including meeting minutes, technical specifications, and revision histories, particularly relevant to the evolving nature of the project requirements.

**Technical Support:**

- **Post-Deployment Support:** Establishing a help-desk system for end-users to address technical issues, usage queries, and troubleshooting post-deployment.
- **Training Material Development:** Creating comprehensive training materials for administrators using the System Console, focusing on system monitoring, user account management, and billing plan adjustments.

**Risk Management:**

- **Network Dependency:** Regular assessment of risks associated with network dependencies, such as server downtimes or bandwidth fluctuations.
- **Software Compatibility Risks:** Evaluating and mitigating risks related to software compatibility across different user devices (laptops, smartphones, desktops).

**Resource Management:**

- **Developer Allocation:** Focused allocation of developers to critical components like server processes, client apps development, and the System Console based on project phase and priorities.
- **Testing Resources:** Allocating sufficient resources for thorough testing phases, including load testing for handling concurrent calls and billing process accuracy.

**Procurement and Contract Management:**

- **Third-party Services:** If any third-party services (like cloud services for hosting the server) are required, managing contracts and ensuring they align with project timelines and quality standards.
- **Software Licensing:** Handling software licensing for any commercial tools or platforms used in the development and deployment of the virtual phone system.
