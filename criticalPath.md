The critical path in project scheduling is the most important path throughout the entire network diagram as it represents the absolutely fastest that a project can be completed.

If every node in the diagram which is not on the critical path had a duration value of 25, and you could reduce each one to 1 instead, the project budget would shrink yet you would not be able to deliver it any sooner.

The reason for this is that the execution of the tasks on the critical path all rely on each other and must be done in the proper sequential order, and the longest path to reach the end is the fastest in which the entire project can be completed.

This showcases how finding and exploring the critical path in a network diagram is a crucial task when it comes to trying to manage project scheduling, moving deadlines, and allocating resources. For example, being able to 
minimize each node as mentioned above proves futile in quickening the project delivery date, however if you are able to change a single node on the critical path from a value of 100 to 20, that could (though not guaranteed)
 speed up the project delivery by a specific margin.
