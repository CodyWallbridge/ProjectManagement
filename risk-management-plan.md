# Risk Management Plan

## Introduction

## Risk Identification

| Risk              | Description | Probability | Potential Loss | Risk Exposure | Risk Category |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Financial Risk | Maintaining an eight-percent growth rate in a financially volatile climate may impact the intended scale and pace of railroad expansion. | 20%  | 100 million | 20 million | Mission and Goals |
| Environmental Risk | All the building might raise environmental concerns, such as habitat disruption or increased carbon emissions, leading to potential public resistance or regulatory hurdles. | 20%  | 10 million | 4 million | Mission and Goals |
| Acceleration problems | If the project is accelerated too much, the result might not be optimal building of the structure | 40% | 100 million | 4 million |  Organization Management |
| Service Disruptions | Potential interruptions in train services due to ongoing construction may impact the passenger experience and potentially leading to dissatisfaction or reduced confidence in the system. | 50% | 500 000 | 250 000 | Customer |
| Communication Challenges | Ensuring effective communication to passengers about schedules changes or road closures given construction might let some people not use the railroad | 60% | 10 million | 6 million | Customer |
| Marketing                 | Ineffective allocation of the marketing budget may result in insufficient market penetration, necessitating additional funds to achieve desired public awareness.                                        | 0.3 | 100,000 | 50,000  | Budget/Cost         |
| Lack of Quality Assurance | Failure to integrate rigorous quality assurance protocols could lead to critical software issues or functional discrepancies, significantly delaying project progress and necessitating costly fixes.    | 0.4 | 300,000 | 125,000 | Development Process |
| Experience                 | Assigning a project manager with inadequate experience could lead to mismanagement and inefficiencies, impacting the project timeline and costs.                                                        | 0.5 | 250,000 | 200,000 | Project Management  |
| Domain Knowledge           | Onboarding a project manager possessing strong PM skills but lacking specific domain expertise in railway reservation systems may cause strategic oversights and misalignment with industry standards.  | 0.6 | 150,000 | 75,000  | Project Management  |
| Communication              | Hiring a project manager facing language and cultural communication barriers with the team could lead to misunderstandings, reduced team cohesion, and compromised project execution.                   | 0.3 | 200,000 | 40,000  | Project Management  |
| Tight Development Timeline           | Given the 90-day deadline to deliver a prototype, there's a significant risk that the project might encounter delays due to unforeseen development challenges or resource constraints. If any phase of the project, such as design, development, or testing, takes longer than expected, it could derail the entire schedule.       | 0.4               | 500,000            | 200,000            | Schedule           |
| Dependency on External Factors       | The project relies on market research and competition analysis, which are expected to be completed in 45 days. Any delays in receiving this information could slow down the development process, impacting the overall schedule.                       | 0.3               | 300,000            | 90,000             | Schedule           |
| Scope Creep                          | Given the project's multifaceted nature (handling diverse ticket types, scalability, multiple language support, and report generation), there’s a risk of scope creep. New features or requirements might be added without extending timelines or adjusting budgets, leading to overwork and potential delays. | 0.5               | 400,000            | 200,000            | Project Content    |
| Cultural and Language Misalignment   | Since the system is being designed for use in various Southeast Asian countries, there's a risk that the content may not be adequately localized or may fail to meet specific cultural or linguistic needs, impacting user acceptance and effectiveness.                            | 0.2               | 250,000            | 50,000             | Project Content    |
| System Scalability and Performance   | The system is expected to handle around 25,000 reservations daily, with significant hour-by-hour, day-by-day, and seasonal variations. There’s a risk that the system may not perform optimally under peak loads or may not scale efficiently as user numbers grow or in case of future expansion to other Southeast Asian countries.               | 0.3               | 600,000            | 180,000            | Performance        |
