There’s a risk that the system may not perform optimally under peak loads or may not scale efficiently as user numbers grow or in case of future expansion to other Southeast Asian countries. | 0.3         | 600,000        | 180,000       | Performance             |

## Key Risk Identification

The prioritization of risks is based on their risk exposure, which is a product of their probability and potential loss:

### Justification

1. **Cultural and Language Misalignment** - High risk due to the likelihood of encountering cultural nuances across different Southeast Asian markets and the substantial financial impact of failing to address these, leading to potential market rejection.

2. **System Scalability and Performance** - Prioritized due to the significant cost implications of performance issues in a system that must handle a high volume of transactions, and the critical need for scalability for future expansion.

3. **Ambiguous Technical Knowledge of Developers** - The combined risk of developers' lack of expertise leading to delays and increased development costs makes this a priority, as it directly impacts the project's timeline and quality.

4. **Inflexibility to Changes** - The high probability of changing requirements necessitates a flexible design approach to avoid costly post-deployment modifications, making it a high risk if not managed properly.

5. **Lack of Quality Assurance** - Given the high potential financial loss from releasing a system with critical defects and the reputational damage that would follow, ensuring thorough QA processes is a top priority.
