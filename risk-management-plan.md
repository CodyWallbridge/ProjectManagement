# Risk Management Plan

## Introduction

## Risk Identification

| Risk | Description | Probability | Potential Loss | Risk Exposure | Risk Category |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Hardware and software limitations | The hardware and software provided by the CRM may not be robust to the technical needs of the project, leading to low performance or feature limitations. | 0.2 | 225,000 | 45,000 | Development Environment |
| Developers' morale and motivation | The previous failure to develop a railway reservation system may cause the developers to lack faith in the project, further leading to decreased motivation, productivity, or quality of work. | 0.4 | 125,000 | 50,000 | Staff |
| Ambiguous technical knowledge of developers | Improving software engineering skills, telecommunication skills, and practical object-oriented programming experience to an adequate level in the development team may cause scheduling delays or reduced productivity as they learn and develop these skills during the project's execution. | 0.5 | 250,000 | 125,000 | Staff |
| Quality of support | The project development team has unknown communication skills and may not be able to communicate with non-technical clients about bugs in the software, lowering the efficiency and efficacy of customer support. | 0.5 | 150,000 | 75,000 | Maintenance |
| Inflexibility to changes | Inexperience with software engineering practices in the development team may result in inflexible software that cannot quickly adapt to customers' requests after product delivery. | 0.7 | 175,000 | 122,500 | Maintenance |
| Marketing                 | Ineffective allocation of the marketing budget may result in insufficient market penetration, necessitating additional funds to achieve desired public awareness.                                        | 0.3 | 100,000 | 50,000  | Budget/Cost         |
| Lack of Quality Assurance | Failure to integrate rigorous quality assurance protocols could lead to critical software issues or functional discrepancies, significantly delaying project progress and necessitating costly fixes.    | 0.4 | 300,000 | 125,000 | Development Process |
| Experience                 | Assigning a project manager with inadequate experience could lead to mismanagement and inefficiencies, impacting the project timeline and costs.                                                        | 0.5 | 250,000 | 200,000 | Project Management  |
| Domain Knowledge           | Onboarding a project manager possessing strong PM skills but lacking specific domain expertise in railway reservation systems may cause strategic oversights and misalignment with industry standards.  | 0.6 | 150,000 | 75,000  | Project Management  |
| Communication              | Hiring a project manager facing language and cultural communication barriers with the team could lead to misunderstandings, reduced team cohesion, and compromised project execution.                   | 0.3 | 200,000 | 40,000  | Project Management  |
| Tight Development Timeline           | Given the 90-day deadline to deliver a prototype, there's a significant risk that the project might encounter delays due to unforeseen development challenges or resource constraints. If any phase of the project, such as design, development, or testing, takes longer than expected, it could derail the entire schedule.       | 0.4               | 500,000            | 200,000            | Schedule           |
| Dependency on External Factors       | The project relies on market research and competition analysis, which are expected to be completed in 45 days. Any delays in receiving this information could slow down the development process, impacting the overall schedule.                       | 0.3               | 300,000            | 90,000             | Schedule           |
| Scope Creep                          | Given the project's multifaceted nature (handling diverse ticket types, scalability, multiple language support, and report generation), there’s a risk of scope creep. New features or requirements might be added without extending timelines or adjusting budgets, leading to overwork and potential delays. | 0.5               | 400,000            | 200,000            | Project Content    |
| Cultural and Language Misalignment   | Since the system is being designed for use in various Southeast Asian countries, there's a risk that the content may not be adequately localized or may fail to meet specific cultural or linguistic needs, impacting user acceptance and effectiveness.                            | 0.2               | 250,000            | 50,000             | Project Content    |
| System Scalability and Performance   | The system is expected to handle around 25,000 reservations daily, with significant hour-by-hour, day-by-day, and seasonal variations. There’s a risk that the system may not perform optimally under peak loads or may not scale efficiently as user numbers grow or in case of future expansion to other Southeast Asian countries.               | 0.3               | 600,000            | 180,000            | Performance        |
