# Risk Management Plan

## Introduction

## Risk Identification

| Risk              | Description | Probability | Potential Loss | Risk Exposure | Risk Category |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Volatile Workflow | Given that some of the team members don't know the language, it might affect the workflow as miscommunication is prone to happen | 0.2  | 100 000  | 20 000 | Mission and Goals |
| Development Team Stability | There are 5 developers that have less than 5 years of experience, they might delay the project as they are learning | 0.3 | 100 000  | 30 000 | Organization Management |
| Support from the CRM | The CRM might not comply with some requests causing problems with resource allocation or team changes | 0.1  | 50 000  | 5 000 | Organization Management |
| No Customer Involvement | Not having user tests during development might make the end product not useful, therefore people wont use it | 0.4  | 250 000  | 100 000 | Customer |
| Scalping of Tickets  | People that scalp tickets to resell will influence the customer experience, they might not get the tickets for a fair price  | 0.4 | 500 000 | 200 000 | Customer |
| Marketing                 | Ineffective allocation of the marketing budget may result in insufficient market penetration, necessitating additional funds to achieve desired public awareness.                                        | 0.3 | 100,000 | 50,000  | Budget/Cost         |
| Lack of Quality Assurance | Failure to integrate rigorous quality assurance protocols could lead to critical software issues or functional discrepancies, significantly delaying project progress and necessitating costly fixes.    | 0.4 | 300,000 | 125,000 | Development Process |
| Experience                 | Assigning a project manager with inadequate experience could lead to mismanagement and inefficiencies, impacting the project timeline and costs.                                                        | 0.5 | 250,000 | 200,000 | Project Management  |
| Domain Knowledge           | Onboarding a project manager possessing strong PM skills but lacking specific domain expertise in railway reservation systems may cause strategic oversights and misalignment with industry standards.  | 0.6 | 150,000 | 75,000  | Project Management  |
| Communication              | Hiring a project manager facing language and cultural communication barriers with the team could lead to misunderstandings, reduced team cohesion, and compromised project execution.                   | 0.3 | 200,000 | 40,000  | Project Management  |
| Tight Development Timeline           | Given the 90-day deadline to deliver a prototype, there's a significant risk that the project might encounter delays due to unforeseen development challenges or resource constraints. If any phase of the project, such as design, development, or testing, takes longer than expected, it could derail the entire schedule.       | 0.4               | 500,000            | 200,000            | Schedule           |
| Dependency on External Factors       | The project relies on market research and competition analysis, which are expected to be completed in 45 days. Any delays in receiving this information could slow down the development process, impacting the overall schedule.                       | 0.3               | 300,000            | 90,000             | Schedule           |
| Scope Creep                          | Given the project's multifaceted nature (handling diverse ticket types, scalability, multiple language support, and report generation), there’s a risk of scope creep. New features or requirements might be added without extending timelines or adjusting budgets, leading to overwork and potential delays. | 0.5               | 400,000            | 200,000            | Project Content    |
| Cultural and Language Misalignment   | Since the system is being designed for use in various Southeast Asian countries, there's a risk that the content may not be adequately localized or may fail to meet specific cultural or linguistic needs, impacting user acceptance and effectiveness.                            | 0.2               | 250,000            | 50,000             | Project Content    |
| System Scalability and Performance   | The system is expected to handle around 25,000 reservations daily, with significant hour-by-hour, day-by-day, and seasonal variations. There’s a risk that the system may not perform optimally under peak loads or may not scale efficiently as user numbers grow or in case of future expansion to other Southeast Asian countries.               | 0.3               | 600,000            | 180,000            | Performance        |
